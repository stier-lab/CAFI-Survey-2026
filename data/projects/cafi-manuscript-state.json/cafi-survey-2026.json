Umbrella Question and Nested Questions\n\n### Umbrella Question\n**What ecological and environmental factors determine the structure, diversity, and spatial organization of coral-associated fauna invertebrate (CAFI) communities within Pocillopora coral colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia?**\n\n### Nested Questions\n- **Q1**: What factors determine CAFI community composition and alpha diversity patterns?\n- **Q2**: How do coral morphological traits (size, branching morphology) and physiological condition affect CAFI community structure?\n- **Q3**: What is the spatial structure and autocorrelation of CAFI distributions across reef sites?\n- **Q4**: What network structures emerge from CAFI species co-occurrence patterns, and do they reflect functional ecological groupings?\n- **Q5**: How do site-level environmental differences influence CAFI-coral relationships?\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hypothesis Tree\n\n### Q1: Community Composition and Diversity Drivers\n- **H1a**: CAFI abundance follows a power-law relationship with coral volume (scaling exponent ~0.75)\n  - *Mechanism*: Larger habitat volume provides more microhabitat niches\n  - *Prediction*: log(abundance) ~ 0.75 \u00d7 log(volume)\n\n- **H1b**: CAFI species richness saturates with coral size following a logarithmic relationship\n  - *Mechanism*: Species accumulation curve levels off as habitat approaches carrying capacity\n  - *Prediction*: Richness ~ log(volume), with diminishing returns\n\n- **H1c**: Shannon diversity shows intermediate response to coral size\n  - *Mechanism*: Balance between species addition and dominance effects\n  - *Prediction*: Unimodal or logarithmic relationship with volume\n\n### Q2: Coral Morphology and Condition Effects\n- **H2a**: Wide-branching corals support higher CAFI diversity than tight-branching morphotypes\n  - *Mechanism*: Increased structural complexity creates more microhabitat heterogeneity\n  - *Prediction*: Shannon diversity: wide > tight branching\n\n- **H2b**: Coral physiological condition positively predicts CAFI abundance\n  - *Mechanism*: Healthier corals provide better habitat quality and resources\n  - *Prediction*: Positive correlation between condition score (PC1) and CAFI metrics\n\n- **H2c**: Morphotype identity (verrucosa, meandrina, eydouxi) affects community composition\n  - *Mechanism*: Species-specific architectural differences create distinct microhabitats\n  - *Prediction*: Significant morphotype effect in PERMANOVA\n\n### Q3: Spatial Structure\n- **H3a**: CAFI communities exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation at local scales\n  - *Mechanism*: Dispersal limitation and environmental similarity create spatial clustering\n  - *Prediction*: Moran's I > 0, p < 0.05\n\n- **H3b**: Spatial autocorrelation decays with distance following exponential or power-law\n  - *Mechanism*: Distance-decay relationships in community similarity\n  - *Prediction*: Correlogram shows declining autocorrelation with distance\n\n- **H3c**: Site identity explains significant variation in CAFI community composition\n  - *Mechanism*: Environmental gradients between fringing reef, lagoon, and barrier reef\n  - *Prediction*: Significant site effect in PERMANOVA (R\u00b2 > 0.1)\n\n### Q4: Network Structure\n- **H4a**: CAFI co-occurrence networks exhibit modular structure\n  - *Mechanism*: Functional groups and niche partitioning create non-random associations\n  - *Prediction*: Network modularity (Q) > 0.3\n\n- **H4b**: Network modules correspond to functional groups (crabs, shrimp, fish, snails)\n  - *Mechanism*: Similar ecological requirements drive within-group associations\n  - *Prediction*: Taxonomic groups cluster within modules\n\n- **H4c**: Keystone species can be identified through high centrality metrics\n  - *Mechanism*: Some species facilitate others or are ecological hubs\n  - *Prediction*: High degree \u00d7 betweenness centrality identifies keystone OTUs\n\n### Q5: Site-Environment Interactions\n- **H5a**: Coral-CAFI relationships vary across sites (interaction effects)\n  - *Mechanism*: Environmental context modifies habitat-diversity relationships\n  - *Prediction*: Significant site \u00d7 coral trait interactions in GLMMs\n\n- **H5b**: Depth effects on CAFI communities vary by site\n  - *Mechanism*: Different depth gradients and environmental conditions per site\n  - *Prediction*: Significant site \u00d7 depth interaction terms\n\n---\n\n## 3.

          "thematic_synthesis": "# Deep Literature Exploration: Coral-Associated Fauna Communities\n\n## 1. Thematic Synthesis\n\n### 1.1 Coral-Associated Cryptic Fauna Diversity\n\n**Key Findings**: Coral colonies harbor remarkably diverse cryptic invertebrate communities, with crustaceans (crabs, shrimp) typically dominating abundance patterns. Stella et al. (2011) documented that cryptic reef fauna can comprise 65-85% of total reef biodiversity, with coral-dwelling species representing a major component. Coles (1980) provided foundational work on Pocillopora-associated fauna, documenting 40+ species in Hawaiian populations.\n\n**Well Established**: \n- Crustaceans dominate coral-associated fauna numerically\n- High beta diversity between coral colonies\n- Strong host-specificity patterns for certain taxa\n\n**Debated**:\n- Relative importance of coral species identity vs. morphology\n- Temporal stability of associations\n- Role of coral condition in structuring communities\n\n### 1.2 Habitat Size Effects and Species-Area Relationships\n\n**Key Findings**: Larger coral colonies consistently support more individuals and species, following power-law scaling relationships. Vytopil & Willis (2001) demonstrated species-area relationships in coral-dwelling fauna with scaling exponents of 0.2-0.4 for richness. Preston (1962) and MacArthur & Wilson (1967) established theoretical foundations for species-area relationships, though coral applications remain limited.\n\n**Well Established**:\n- Positive correlation between coral size and fauna abundance\n- Power-law scaling relationships are common\n- Surface area often better predictor than volume\n\n**Debated**:\n- Optimal scaling exponents for different coral morphologies\n- Whether relationships saturate at large colony sizes\n- Relative importance of volume vs. surface area vs. structural complexity\n\n### 1.3 Coral Morphological Effects on Associated Communities\n\n**Key Findings**: Coral architectural complexity strongly influences associated fauna diversity and composition. Vytopil & Willis (2001) showed that branching corals support higher cryptic diversity than massive forms. Risk (1972) documented morphology-specific associations in Caribbean corals. Glynn (1983) established that coral branching patterns affect guardian crab distributions.\n\n**Well Established**:\n- Branching corals support higher cryptic diversity than massive forms\n- Structural complexity creates microhabitat heterogeneity\n- Species-specific preferences for coral architectures\n\n**Debated**:\n- Optimal metrics for quantifying coral complexity\n- Relative importance of branch spacing vs. colony size\n- Interaction effects between morphology and environmental conditions\n\n### 1.4 Mutualistic Networks in Coral Systems\n\n**Key Findings**: Coral-associated fauna exhibit complex interaction networks, including obligate mutualisms and commensalisms. Glynn (1983) documented Trapezia crab-coral mutualisms, where crabs defend corals from predators. Patton (1994) showed network modularity in coral-associated communities. Bascompte & Jordano (2007) established theoretical frameworks for mutualistic network analysis.\n\n**Well Established**:\n- Guardian crab mutualisms are widespread and well-documented\n- Network approaches reveal non-random association patterns\n- Modularity reflects functional groupings\n\n**Debated**:\n- Extent of true mutualism vs. commensalism\n- Stability of network structures over time\n- Methods for identifying keystone species in networks\n\n### 1.5 Spatial Patterns and Autocorrelation\n\n**Key Findings**: Coral-associated communities show significant spatial structure at multiple scales. Legendre (1993) established methods for detecting spatial autocorrelation in ecological communities. Cornell & Lawton (1992) documented species-area relationships at landscape scales. Local dispersal limitation creates spatial clustering in marine invertebrates.\n\n**Well Established**:\n- Positive spatial autocorrelation at local scales (10s-100s meters)\n- Distance-decay relationships in community similarity\n- Site-level environmental effects on community structure\n\n**Debated**:\n- Optimal spatial scales for analysis\n- Relative importance of dispersal vs. environmental filtering\n- Methods for partitioning spatial vs. environmental effects\n\n### 1.6 Coral Health and Physiological Indicators\n\n**Key Findings**: Coral physiological condition affects associated fauna communities through habitat quality effects. Muscatine et al. (1989) established protein and carbohydrate content as coral health indicators. Fitt et al. (2001) documented zooxanthellae density relationships with coral condition. Healthy corals provide better habitat structure and potentially more resources.\n\n**Well Established**:\n- Protein/carbohydrate ratios indicate coral nutritional status\n- Zooxanthellae density correlates with coral health\n- Position effects on coral physiology are significant\n\n**Debated**:\n- Best integrated measures of coral condition\n- Causal relationships between coral health and fauna\n- Temporal stability of condition-fauna relationships\n\n## 2. Gap Map\n\n### Gaps Addressed by Current Project\n\n**Gap 1: Quantitative coral morphology-fauna relationships**\n- **Literature Gap**: Most studies use categorical morphology classifications\n- **Project Addresses**: Continuous branch width measurements and volume scaling\n- **Links to Hypotheses**: H2a (branch width effects), H1a (volume scaling)\n\n**Gap 2: Integrated coral condition effects**\n- **Literature Gap**: Studies typically examine single physiological variables\n- **Project Addresses**: Position-corrected multivariate condition score (PC1)\n- **Links to Hypotheses**: H2b (condition-fauna relationships)\n\n**Gap 3: Network structure of coral-fauna communities**\n- **Literature Gap**: Limited application of network analysis to coral cryptic fauna\n- **Project Addresses**: Co-occurrence networks and modularity analysis\n- **Links to Hypotheses**: H4a-c (network modularity and keystone species)\n\n**Gap 4: Spatial autocorrelation in coral-associated communities**\n- **Literature Gap**: Spatial structure rarely quantified in coral fauna studies\n- **Project Addresses**: Moran's I analysis and spatial modeling\n- **Links to Hypotheses**: H3a-b (spatial autocorrelation patterns)\n\n**Gap 5: Multi-site comparative analysis**\n- **Literature Gap**: Most studies focus on single sites or habitats\n- **Project Addresses**: Three reef environments (fringing, lagoon, barrier)\n- **Links to Hypotheses**: H5a-b (site interaction effects)\n\n**Gap 6: OTU-level resolution with large sample sizes**\n- **Literature Gap**: Many studies limited by small sample sizes or coarse taxonomy\n- **Project Addresses**: 204 colonies, 243 OTUs, 2,847 individuals\n- **Links to Hypotheses**: All hypotheses benefit from increased statistical power\n\n## 3.

            "draft_introduction": "# Introduction\n\n## Coral Reef Cryptic Biodiversity and Habitat Complexity\n\nCoral reefs support exceptional biodiversity, harboring an estimated 25% of all marine species within less than 1% of ocean area (Reaka-Kudla et al. 1997). While large, conspicuous reef organisms have received extensive research attention, cryptic invertebrate fauna may comprise 65-85% of total reef biodiversity (Stella et al. 2011). Among these cryptic communities, coral-associated invertebrate fauna (CAFI) represent a particularly diverse and ecologically important component, yet remain understudied relative to their abundance and potential functional roles (Coles 1980; Patton 1994).\n\nCoral colonies function as discrete habitat patches within the reef matrix, creating three-dimensional living structures that provide shelter, feeding opportunities, and breeding sites for numerous invertebrate species (Risk 1972). The architectural complexity of coral skeletons generates a hierarchy of microhabitats, from large interstitial spaces between branches to minute crevices within the coral surface (Vytopil & Willis 2001). This structural heterogeneity, combined with the dynamic nature of living coral habitat, creates conditions that support remarkably diverse cryptic assemblages dominated numerically by crustaceans, particularly crabs and shrimp (Glynn 1983; Patton 1994).\n\n## Habitat Size, Morphology, and Species-Area Relationships\n\nThe relationship between habitat size and species diversity represents a fundamental pattern in ecology, with species-area relationships providing one of ecology's few \"laws\" (MacArthur & Wilson 1967; Rosenzweig 1995). In coral reef systems, individual coral colonies represent discrete habitat islands of varying size and complexity, making them ideal natural experiments for testing species-area theory at small spatial scales (Vytopil & Willis 2001). Larger coral colonies consistently support higher abundances and species richness of associated fauna, typically following power-law scaling relationships with exponents ranging from 0.2-0.4 for species richness (Preston 1962; Vytopil & Willis 2001).\n\nBeyond simple size effects, coral morphological architecture strongly influences associated fauna communities. Branching coral species consistently support higher cryptic diversity than massive growth forms, reflecting the greater structural complexity and microhabitat heterogeneity provided by three-dimensional branching patterns (Risk 1972; Vytopil & Willis 2001). Within branching corals, variation in branch spacing, thickness, and colony architecture creates distinct habitat templates that may filter associated communities based on species-specific morphological and behavioral requirements.\n\n## Coral-Associated Fauna Communities and Mutualistic Networks\n\nPocillopora corals support particularly diverse cryptic assemblages throughout the Indo-Pacific, with documented associations including over 40 species in Hawaiian populations alone (Coles 1980). These communities exhibit complex interaction networks extending beyond simple commensal relationships. Guardian crab mutualisms, particularly involving Trapezia species, exemplify well-documented coral-fauna interactions where crabs defend coral hosts from predation while receiving shelter and nutrition (Glynn 1983). Such mutualistic relationships suggest that coral-associated communities may exhibit non-random co-occurrence patterns reflecting functional ecological groupings.\n\nNetwork analysis approaches, increasingly applied to mutualistic systems, reveal modular structures that reflect functional organization and potential keystone species effects (Bascompte & Jordano 2007). In coral-associated communities, network modularity may reflect taxonomic groupings (crabs, shrimp, fish, gastropods) or functional guilds sharing similar ecological requirements. Identifying keystone species through centrality metrics could reveal community assembly mechanisms and guide conservation priorities.\n\n## Spatial Structure and Environmental Context\n\nMarine invertebrate communities commonly exhibit spatial autocorrelation due to dispersal limitation, environmental gradients, and biotic interactions (Legendre 1993). In coral reef systems, spatial structure may emerge at multiple scales, from local clustering due to limited larval dispersal to broad-scale patterns reflecting environmental gradients across reef zones. Understanding spatial autocorrelation is critical for appropriate statistical inference and reveals fundamental processes structuring ecological communities.\n\nCoral reef environments exhibit strong environmental gradients from nearshore fringing reefs to offshore barrier reefs, with systematic variation in wave energy, sedimentation, temperature, and water quality (Done 1982). These environmental differences may directly affect coral-associated fauna through physiological constraints or indirectly through effects on coral host condition and habitat quality. Coral physiological condition, integrating protein content, carbohydrate reserves, and symbiotic algae density, provides a measure of habitat quality that may strongly influence associated fauna communities (Muscatine et al. 1989; Fitt et al. 2001).\n\n## Study System and Research Objectives\n\nMo'orea, French Polynesia represents an ideal model system for studying coral-associated fauna communities, combining well-characterized reef environments with diverse Pocillopora populations exhibiting distinct morphological forms. The lagoon system encompasses fringing reefs, back-reef environments, and barrier reef slopes, providing natural gradients in environmental conditions and coral community structure. Pocillopora's morphological diversity, ranging from tight-branching to wide-branching forms across three primary morphotypes (verrucosa, meandrina, eydouxi), creates a natural experiment for testing morphological effects on associated communities.\n\nThis study addresses five key questions regarding the ecological and environmental factors determining CAFI community structure in Mo'orea's Pocillopora populations: (1) What factors determine community composition and alpha diversity patterns? (2) How do coral morphological traits and physiological condition affect community structure? (3) What spatial structure characterizes CAFI distributions across reef sites? (4) What network structures emerge from species co-occurrence patterns? (5) How do site-level environmental differences influence coral-fauna relationships?\n\nWe hypothesize that CAFI abundance will scale with coral volume following power-law relationships (H1a), while species richness will show logarithmic saturation with coral size (H1b). We predict that wide-branching corals will support higher diversity than tight-branching morphotypes (H2a), and that coral physiological condition will positively predict CAFI abundance (H2b). We expect positive spatial autocorrelation at local scales (H3a) and modular network structure reflecting functional groupings (H4a). Finally, we predict that coral-CAFI relationships will vary across sites due to environmental context effects (H5a). These hypotheses integrate habitat heterogeneity theory, species-area relationships, and mutualistic network concepts to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding coral-associated fauna community assembly."

            "draft_methods": "# Introduction\n\n## Coral Reef Cryptic Biodiversity and Community Assembly\n\nCoral reefs harbor exceptional biodiversity, with cryptic invertebrate fauna comprising 65-85% of total reef species richness (Stella et al. 2011). Within this hidden diversity, coral-associated fauna represent a particularly understudied yet ecologically significant component of reef ecosystems. Individual coral colonies function as discrete habitat patches, supporting diverse assemblages of crabs, shrimp, gastropods, polychaetes, and other invertebrates that live within the complex three-dimensional architecture of coral branches (Coles 1980). These coral-associated fauna invertebrate (CAFI) communities provide critical ecosystem services, including coral defense against predators and parasites, nutrient cycling, and maintenance of coral health through cleaning behaviors (Glynn 1983).\n\n## Habitat Size and Architectural Complexity as Community Drivers\n\nThe relationship between habitat size and species diversity represents one of the most fundamental patterns in community ecology, with species-area relationships documented across ecosystems from islands to forest fragments (MacArthur & Wilson 1967). In coral reef systems, individual coral colonies function as habitat islands of varying size and structural complexity, creating natural experiments for testing ecological theory. Larger coral colonies consistently support higher abundances and species richness of associated fauna, typically following power-law scaling relationships with exponents ranging from 0.2-0.4 for species richness (Vytopil & Willis 2001). However, the mechanisms underlying these patterns\u2014whether driven primarily by habitat volume, surface area, or architectural complexity\u2014remain poorly resolved.\n\nCoral morphological diversity creates distinct habitat templates that influence associated fauna communities through multiple pathways. Branching coral architectures generate complex three-dimensional matrices of microhabitats, with branch spacing, colony volume, and surface rugosity all potentially affecting species colonization and persistence (Risk 1972). Wide-branching morphologies may support higher diversity than tight-branching forms by providing greater microhabitat heterogeneity and reducing intraspecific competition among residents. However, quantitative relationships between specific morphological traits and community structure remain largely unexplored, with most studies relying on categorical classifications rather than continuous morphometric data.\n\n## Coral-Associated Fauna Community Structure\n\nPocillopora corals support particularly diverse cryptic assemblages throughout the Indo-Pacific, with crustaceans typically dominating both abundance and species richness patterns (Coles 1980). These communities exhibit high beta diversity between colonies, suggesting strong stochastic colonization processes or fine-scale environmental filtering. Guardian crab mutualisms, particularly involving Trapezia species, represent some of the best-documented coral-fauna interactions, where crabs defend host corals from crown-of-thorns starfish and other predators in exchange for shelter and feeding opportunities (Glynn 1983). However, the broader network of species interactions within coral-associated communities, including potential facilitative and competitive relationships, remains poorly characterized.\n\n## Spatial Structure and Environmental Context\n\nMarine invertebrate communities commonly exhibit spatial autocorrelation due to dispersal limitation, environmental gradients, and biotic interactions (Legendre 1993). In coral reef systems, spatial patterns in associated fauna may reflect both local dispersal processes and site-level environmental differences in water quality, flow regimes, and predation pressure. Understanding spatial structure is critical for appropriate statistical inference, as spatially autocorrelated observations violate assumptions of independence in standard statistical models. Moreover, environmental context may modify coral-fauna relationships, with habitat size effects potentially varying across different reef environments or depth gradients.\n\n## Coral Health and Habitat Quality\n\nCoral physiological condition represents a potentially important but understudied driver of associated fauna communities. Healthier corals may provide superior habitat quality through enhanced structural integrity, increased resource availability, or reduced susceptibility to disturbance. Coral condition can be assessed through multiple physiological indicators, including protein and carbohydrate content, zooxanthellae density, and integrated multivariate condition scores (Muscatine et al. 1989; Fitt et al. 2001). However, coral physiology is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as depth and position within colonies, requiring careful statistical correction to isolate condition effects from confounding variables.\n\n## Study Objectives and Hypotheses\n\nThis study addresses fundamental questions about community assembly processes in coral-associated fauna using Pocillopora coral colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia as a model system. Mo'orea's well-studied reef system provides an ideal natural laboratory, with Pocillopora dominance and morphological diversity creating opportunities to examine habitat size effects, morphological influences, and environmental context simultaneously. We sampled 114 coral colonies across three reef environments (fringing reef, lagoon, and barrier reef) to quantify CAFI community structure and test specific hypotheses about assembly processes.\n\nWe predict that CAFI abundance will follow a power-law relationship with coral volume (H1a), while species richness will show a saturating logarithmic relationship reflecting habitat capacity constraints (H1b). We hypothesize that wide-branching coral morphologies will support higher diversity than tight-branching forms due to increased structural complexity (H2a), and that coral physiological condition will positively predict CAFI abundance and richness (H2b). We expect CAFI communities to exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation at local scales due to dispersal limitation (H3a), and to show modular network structure reflecting functional ecological groupings (H4a). Finally, we predict that environmental context will modify coral-fauna relationships, with site-specific interaction effects on community assembly patterns (H5a).\n\nBy integrating habitat scaling theory, spatial ecology, and network analysis approaches, this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding community assembly processes in coral-associated fauna and contributes to broader ecological theory about habitat fragmentation and biodiversity maintenance in marine ecosystems."

            "draft_results": "# Introduction\n\nCoral reef ecosystems harbor extraordinary biodiversity, with cryptic invertebrate fauna comprising an estimated 65-85% of total reef species richness (Stella et al., 2011). Among the most diverse and poorly understood components of this hidden biodiversity are the coral-associated fauna invertebrate (CAFI) communities that inhabit the three-dimensional structures of coral colonies. These cryptic assemblages, dominated by crustaceans, polychaetes, and mollusks, represent a critical but understudied component of reef ecosystem functioning (Coles, 1980; Patton, 1994).\n\nThe structure and diversity of coral-associated communities are fundamentally shaped by the habitat architecture provided by their coral hosts. Coral colonies function as discrete habitat patches, creating complex three-dimensional frameworks that support diverse microhabitat niches (Risk, 1972). This habitat heterogeneity follows predictable scaling relationships, where larger and more structurally complex corals support proportionally more individuals and species\u2014a pattern consistent with classical species-area theory (MacArthur & Wilson, 1967; Vytopil & Willis, 2001). However, the specific mechanisms underlying these habitat size effects remain poorly quantified, particularly for continuous measures of coral morphology and volume.\n\nCoral morphological diversity creates distinct architectural templates that differentially influence associated fauna communities. Branching corals, such as those in the genus *Pocillopora*, exhibit remarkable variation in colony architecture, from tight, densely packed branches to open, widely spaced morphologies (Veron, 2000). These morphological differences translate into variation in structural complexity, surface area-to-volume ratios, and internal space availability\u2014factors that should predictably influence the capacity to support cryptic fauna (Vytopil & Willis, 2001). Despite this theoretical foundation, few studies have quantitatively linked continuous measures of coral morphology to associated fauna diversity patterns.\n\nThe interactions between coral-associated species extend beyond simple habitat provision to encompass complex networks of mutualistic, commensal, and competitive relationships. Guardian crab mutualisms exemplify these interactions, where *Trapezia* and *Tetralia* crabs defend coral hosts from predators and competitors in exchange for shelter and nutrition (Glynn, 1983). Such obligate associations suggest that coral-associated communities may exhibit non-random co-occurrence patterns and modular network structures that reflect functional ecological groupings (Bascompte & Jordano, 2007). However, network approaches have been rarely applied to coral-associated fauna communities, limiting our understanding of species interaction patterns and keystone species identification.\n\nSpatial structure represents another fundamental but understudied aspect of coral-associated communities. Marine invertebrate communities commonly exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation due to dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, and biotic interactions (Legendre, 1993). For coral-associated fauna with limited dispersal capabilities, spatial clustering should emerge at local scales, with community similarity declining predictably with distance. Understanding these spatial patterns is crucial for interpreting community assembly processes and designing appropriate sampling strategies, yet spatial autocorrelation has been rarely quantified in coral fauna studies.\n\nThe physiological condition of coral hosts likely plays a critical role in structuring associated fauna communities through effects on habitat quality and resource availability. Coral health, as measured by protein and carbohydrate reserves, symbiont density, and other physiological indicators, varies substantially within and among colonies (Muscatine et al., 1989; Fitt et al., 2001). Healthier corals may provide superior habitat through enhanced structural integrity, increased resource production, or improved chemical cues. However, most studies examining coral condition effects have focused on single physiological variables rather than integrated measures of coral health, limiting our understanding of condition-fauna relationships.\n\n*Pocillopora* corals in Mo'orea, French Polynesia, provide an ideal system for investigating coral-associated fauna community patterns. These branching corals exhibit substantial morphological diversity, occur across diverse reef environments, and support rich cryptic fauna assemblages (Coles, 1980). The lagoon system of Mo'orea encompasses distinct habitat types\u2014fringing reefs, lagoon patch reefs, and barrier reef slopes\u2014that provide environmental gradients for examining site-level effects on coral-fauna relationships. This system thus offers the opportunity to integrate habitat size effects, morphological influences, spatial patterns, and environmental context in a comprehensive analysis of community assembly processes.\n\nThis study addresses five key questions about coral-associated fauna community structure in Mo'orea *Pocillopora* corals: (1) What factors determine CAFI community composition and alpha diversity patterns? (2) How do coral morphological traits and physiological condition affect CAFI community structure? (3) What is the spatial structure and autocorrelation of CAFI distributions across reef sites? (4) What network structures emerge from CAFI species co-occurrence patterns? (5) How do site-level environmental differences influence CAFI-coral relationships?\n\nWe test five primary hypotheses based on ecological theory and previous empirical work. First, we predict that CAFI abundance will follow a power-law relationship with coral volume (scaling exponent ~0.75), while species richness will show a logarithmic relationship due to species accumulation saturation (H1a-b). Second, we hypothesize that wide-branching coral morphologies will support higher CAFI diversity than tight-branching forms due to increased structural complexity, and that coral physiological condition will positively predict CAFI abundance through habitat quality effects (H2a-b). Third, we predict that CAFI communities will exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation at local scales, with autocorrelation strength declining exponentially with distance (H3a-b). Fourth, we hypothesize that CAFI co-occurrence networks will exhibit modular structure reflecting functional ecological groupings, with identifiable keystone species showing high centrality metrics (H4a-c). Finally, we predict that coral-CAFI relationships will vary across sites due to environmental context effects, with significant site-by-coral trait interactions (H5a-b). These hypotheses integrate habitat size theory, spatial ecology, network theory, and environmental context to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding coral-associated fauna community assembly."

            "draft_discussion": "# Methods\n\n## Study System and Site Selection\n\nThis study was conducted in the coral reef lagoon system of Mo'orea, French Polynesia (17\u00b030'S, 149\u00b050'W) during the austral summer of 2019. Mo'orea's well-characterized reef system provides an ideal natural laboratory for coral ecology research, with distinct habitat zones and abundant Pocillopora populations. We selected three sites representing different reef environments: Hauru Point (HAU) on the northwest fringing reef, Maharepa (MAT) in the northern lagoon, and Moorea Biocode Ridge (MRB) on the northern barrier reef. These sites span gradients in wave exposure, depth, and water quality that are characteristic of Indo-Pacific reef systems.\n\n## Coral Sampling and Morphological Measurements\n\nWe employed a stratified sampling design to capture variation in coral colony size and morphology within each site. At each site, we haphazardly selected Pocillopora coral colonies across a depth range of 2-15 meters, targeting a representative size distribution from small juvenile colonies (~50 cm\u00b3) to large adult colonies (>2000 cm\u00b3). A total of 114 coral colonies were sampled across the three sites (HAU: n=37, MAT: n=39, MRB: n=38).\n\nFor each coral colony, we recorded GPS coordinates, depth, and sampling position within the water column. Three-dimensional coral morphology was quantified using the displacement method for volume estimation and photogrammetric techniques for surface area calculation. Coral colony volume was measured by submerging intact colonies in graduated containers and recording displaced water volume to the nearest 10 mL. Surface area was estimated using a standardized photogrammetric protocol with scaling references.\n\nCoral morphological traits were characterized following established Pocillopora classification schemes. Branch width was categorized as either \"tight\" (narrow, closely-spaced branches) or \"wide\" (broad, open branching architecture) based on visual assessment of overall colony structure. Morphotype identity was classified into three categories: *verrucosa* (compact, cauliflower-like), *meandrina* (intermediate branching), and *eydouxi* (plate-like with vertical branches), following morphological keys for Pocillopora species complexes.\n\n## Coral Physiological Condition Assessment\n\nCoral physiological condition was assessed using a suite of biochemical and cellular metrics. Small tissue samples (~2 cm\u00b2) were collected from each coral colony using bone cutters, taking care to sample from standardized positions on the colony to minimize position-related variation. Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and transported to the laboratory for analysis.\n\nCoral tissue was removed from skeleton using an airbrush technique with filtered seawater, and the resulting tissue slurry was homogenized. Protein content was quantified using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Carbohydrate content was measured using the anthrone method with glucose standards. Zooxanthellae density was determined by direct cell counts using a hemocytometer after tissue homogenization. All physiological metrics were normalized to coral surface area.\n\nTo account for potential position effects on coral physiology, we measured the vertical position of each tissue sample within the water column. Physiological variables were corrected for position effects using linear regression, and residuals were used in subsequent analyses. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the position-corrected physiological variables (protein, carbohydrate, zooxanthellae density) to derive an integrated coral condition score. The first principal component (PC1) was used as a composite measure of coral physiological condition.\n\n## Coral-Associated Fauna Collection and Processing\n\nCoral-associated fauna invertebrates (CAFI) were collected using a standardized extraction protocol. Immediately after morphological measurements, coral colonies were carefully removed from the reef and placed in sealed collection bags underwater. Colonies were transported to a field station and processed within 2 hours of collection.\n\nFauna extraction followed established protocols for coral cryptic communities. Coral colonies were first anesthetized using clove oil solution (0.1 mg/L eugenol) for 10 minutes to immobilize mobile fauna. Colonies were then vigorously agitated in seawater, and the resulting wash water was filtered through nested sieves (2 mm, 1 mm, 500 \u03bcm, 250 \u03bcm mesh sizes). All retained material was preserved in 95% ethanol for subsequent sorting and identification.\n\nFauna specimens were sorted under magnification (10-40x) and identified to the finest taxonomic resolution possible using morphological characters. Identification was performed using regional taxonomic keys and expert consultation. Specimens were classified into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on consistent morphological features, resulting in 243 distinct OTUs across all samples. All specimens were photographed and catalogued, with voucher specimens retained for verification.\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\n### Community Composition Analysis\n\nCoral-associated fauna community composition was analyzed using multivariate statistical approaches. Community data were organized as a species-by-site matrix with OTU abundances. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was used as the primary distance metric, as it is appropriate for count data and emphasizes compositional differences rather than shared absences.\n\nPermutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to test for differences in community composition among categorical predictors (site, morphotype, branch width). PERMANOVA tests were performed with 9999 permutations, and effect sizes were quantified using R\u00b2 values. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination was used for visualization of community patterns in reduced dimension space.\n\n### Species-Area Relationship Modeling\n\nThe relationship between coral habitat size and CAFI diversity metrics was modeled using generalized linear models (GLMs) appropriate for count and continuous response variables. CAFI abundance was modeled using negative binomial regression to account for overdispersion in count data. Species richness was modeled using Poisson regression, with overdispersion assessed using deviance-based diagnostics. Shannon diversity was modeled using Gaussian regression after confirming normality of residuals.\n\nCoral volume was log-transformed to linearize expected power-law relationships, and models took the form: log(response) ~ log(volume) + site + additional predictors. Model selection was performed using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and model assumptions were validated using residual diagnostics.\n\n### Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis\n\nSpatial structure in CAFI communities was quantified using spatial autocorrelation analysis. Global Moran's I statistic was calculated for abundance, richness, and Shannon diversity using coral colony coordinates. Significance was assessed using 9999 Monte Carlo permutations under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation.\n\nSpatial correlograms were constructed to examine distance-decay relationships in community similarity. Mantel tests were used to assess correlations between geographic distance matrices and community dissimilarity matrices, with significance assessed through permutation tests.\n\n### Network Analysis\n\nSpecies co-occurrence networks were constructed to identify non-random association patterns among CAFI OTUs. Co-occurrence strength was quantified using the C-score metric, which measures the degree to which species pairs co-occur more or less frequently than expected by chance. Network edges were defined based on statistically significant co-occurrences (p < 0.05) after correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method.\n\nNetwork modularity was quantified using the Louvain algorithm for community detection. Newman's modularity (Q) was calculated to assess the degree of modular structure, with Q > 0.3 indicating moderate modularity. The statistical significance of observed modularity was assessed by comparison to null networks generated through randomization of node labels.\n\nKeystone species were identified using centrality metrics including degree centrality (number of connections) and betweenness centrality (frequency of occurrence on shortest paths between other nodes). Species with high composite centrality scores (degree \u00d7 betweenness) were considered potential keystone taxa.\n\n### Mixed-Effects Modeling\n\nTo account for potential non-independence due to spatial clustering, mixed-effects models were employed with site as a random intercept. This approach allows for site-specific baseline differences while estimating fixed effects of coral traits on CAFI metrics. Model selection between fixed-effects and mixed-effects approaches was performed using likelihood ratio tests.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.3.0. Key packages included vegan for community analysis, MASS for GLMs, spdep for spatial analysis, igraph for network analysis, and lme4 for mixed-effects models. Significance was assessed at \u03b1 = 0.05, with effect sizes reported alongside p-values to aid interpretation."
