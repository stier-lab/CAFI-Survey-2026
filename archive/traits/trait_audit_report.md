Seed file: data/Survey/1. survey_cafi_data_w_taxonomy_summer2019_v5.csv

## Summary Statistics
- Total taxa processed: 233
- WoRMS matches: 232
- Unresolved taxa: 1
- With functional roles: 54

## Trait Coverage
- aphia_id: 232/233 (99.6%)
- functional_role: 54/233 (23.2%)
- max_length_mm: 0/233 (0.0%)
- depth_min_m: 0/233 (0.0%)
- trophic_level: 0/233 (0.0%)

## Data Sources Used
- WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species)
- Curated functional role database from peer-reviewed literature

## Limitations
- SeaLifeBase/FishBase API queries not yet implemented (requires API keys)
- Life history traits (size, depth, reproduction) mostly unknown pending database access
- Functional roles based on genus-level inference where species-level data unavailable

## Next Steps
1. Obtain API access for FishBase/SeaLifeBase
2. Systematic literature review for species-specific functional roles
3. Add trait data for unresolved taxa
4. Validate functional role assignments with domain expert
